    <h4>OVERVIEW:</h4>
    <p class="projecttext">
  Collaborating with the Human Resources Student's Association (HRSA), which is a student organization
  at Simon Fraser University's Beedie School of Business, I functioned as their main designer for 2 months,
  working on their pillar event, Spring Soirée. HRSA's annual stand-up networking event, Spring Soirée,
  explores topics surrounding Human Resources.

    <h4>  PROCESS:</h4>
    <p class="projecttext">

      The club provided me with their previous logos
      from 2012 and 2016, and I was given the task to re-brand! I roughly sketched
      out some initial designs, questioning if I should go for either a fancy or
      modern approach.

  Putting some of my sketches through Adobe Illustrator, I began to experiment with different letter arrangements
  and colours. At first, I used Spring Soirée's main orange colour as I wanted to ensure I maintained consistent
  branding with the event. However, I went onto HRSA's website and found that I really enjoyed their colour palette
  and took inspiration from that.

      After recieving feedback on the first logo iteration, the club found that it was
      not on-brand for their Spring Soirée event because the main colour is orange;
      the blue one matched to just HRSA. Furthermore, the logo was deemed too simple and
      modern for Spring Soirée as they wanted something fancier, to not just encapsulate the
      business side of the event but also the Soirée.

      </figure>

      <p class="projecttext">
        Taking all the feedback they gave me, I found inspiration online while browsing through
        fancy logos and created an icon that captures the season of Spring and its liveliness.
        However, I soon realized that this logo was not scalable and the detailing in the leaves
        would disappear as the scale decreased, therefore I had to find a way to simplify everything.

        <h4> FINAL SPRING SOIREE LOGO: </h4>
        <img class="project_image limited" alt="final_logo" src="images/SS_Rebrand/white_bg_logo.jpg">

  <h4> CHALLENGES: </h4>
  <p class="projecttext">
  Communicating with such a large club was very difficult in terms of creating a finalize logo
  design for their event. I had to wait at least 3 weeks before the entire club could send me any
  feedback in regards to the logo because core members would not be available.
  <br>
  <br>
  This caused coordinators to not meet deliverable deadlines, which heavily affected my work as I
  could not design without their content. Therefore, I took the initiative to create designs prior
  to the deadlines with the information I had.
    </p>

    <h4> REFLECTION:</h4>
    <p class="projecttext">
      Overall, my involvement with the Human Resources Student's Association has taught me a valuable
      lesson to not only iterate through multiple designs within a short time frame, but as well as
      being able to produce multiple ideas, learning to not be attached to a single concept.
